# Laguerre

Laguerre is a trend indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It was originally developed by Emerald King for MetaTrader 4 platform. It is based on a continuous moving average of the price with multiple exponential elements.

Laguerre can be used either as a level indicator to spot trend reversals or as a divergence indicator.
